# Mini-Microservice_BlogApp
A simple blog containing post and comment feature with microservice style of implementation.

The blog website demonstrates the microservice concepts as I broke up the posts, comments, query and moderation services into independent services and communicate by the EventBus service.

The following picture shows the access point of each service and how they communicate with each other.
